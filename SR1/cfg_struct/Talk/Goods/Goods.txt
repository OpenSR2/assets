AnswerNotGoods=Your demands are justified. But I have no cargo.
AnswerNotGoods1=I've just unloaded my cargo and I'm all empty. Sorry, next time I'll give you everything.
AnswerNotGoods2=I can't suggest you anything except kippers in tomato sauce. Oh, no, even kippers are all gone!
DiplomatLongDistance=First try to catch me and then demand. Diplomatic vessels are the fastest in Galaxy!
DiplomatLongDistance1=You're talking to the captain of a high-speed spaceship. My ship can easily escape any pirate.
DiplomatNo=Don't try to take the cargo by force. I'm armed and very dangerous!
DiplomatOk=I was just taking a few presents for my relatives. I'm ready to share them with you. Don't shoot.
DiplomatOk1=Funny, I really seem to have a few crates with goods lying around. I'm giving you the best pick. Just don't press down on me.
LinerLongDistance=My liner has a cool engine of the latest modification. First try catching me and then make your threats!
LinerLongDistance1=My liner has a cool engine of the latest modification.
LinerNo=No! I still have my right to defend my property.
LinerOk=We'll give you all that we can, but don't kill us!
LinerOk1=I was told, I really was, space is full of fraggles. Here, look! I have to do as you say. Now I'll throw out my cargo.
PirateLongDistance=You'd better fly closer first and then make your threats. A true pirate looks at the death's face and not begs for a sop at the distance.
PirateLongDistance1=Colleague, I'll give you a piece of advise.
PirateLongDistance1=There's no point in piracy when you can't catch and kill your target. You can throw dust only in rookie's eyes.
PirateNo=I got this cargo in an honest fight. Wanna try taking it away from me? :-)
PirateNo1=I think there are too many competitors in my field. I used to share, but not now, no.
PirateNo2=Your sight test is overdue if you think there's "Snot" written on my side. Get out of my way, you scumbag!
PirateOk=Hey-hey, and I thought I was the coolest guy around here. Well, you're right, I'll now throw out part of my cargo. Fancy some smuggled goods?
PirateOk1=Silly ain't it: me robber and criminal myself, and I get robbed? Oh all right, me doesn't want to quarrel with pals. Ok, I'll throw out part of my cargo.
PlayerSend=This is robbery! Life or cargo?
RangerLongDistance=What? I can't hear you, some interference in the air... Fly closer so we can talk.
RangerLongDistance1=I think that even if you're stronger, you're no way faster than me. Try catching me first and then make your threats!
RangerNo=I'm in a mean mood today. Don't make it worse by your demands for my cargo. The cargo is mine, that's it! Get lost until I lose my temper.
RangerNo1=Hmmmm... Some bastard wants my cargo, did I hear you right? You'd better stop it, or I'll show you where Klissans spend winter...
RangerOk=I agree to give you part of the cargo, just don't shoot.
RangerOk1=All right, all right, I'm giving you part of my cargo.
Send=It is my territory and it's extremely difficult to guard it. Every ship must share its cargo with me.
Send1=I demand giving me your cargo, otherwise I'm not answering for my actions.
Send2=I'm collecting tribute. Throw your cargo overboard or I'll attack you.

TransportNo=I've been working all my life for this cargo and I'm not prepared to abandon it without good reason.
TransportNo1=What, what? Give cargo? And what's this talk about right to property and convention on civil rights?
TransportOk=I'm working day and night, and then some scum puts me in the red! Now I'll throw out everything that I have. Just don't shoot!
TransportOk1=Yes, I've really got some cargo in my hold that I don't need. I've been waiting for an opportunity to get rid of it.
WarriorLongDistance= not talk
WarriorNo='Allo, rookie! You better look who you are talking with! We'll now turn and blow your tub straight to hell!
WarriorOk= not talk
WeAlreadyHavePact=Obviously, you've made a mistake. I'm your friend and we already have peace agreement.
