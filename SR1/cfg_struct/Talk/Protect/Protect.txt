ComputerNotFearAndWar=Shut your trap, <Player>. I won't listen to your babble! You're my next.
DiplomatNo=You're, maybe, right as a diplomat, <Player>. War is not the best way of proving your case. But now I'm so angry that I just can't simply forgive the offender.
DiplomatOk=I see, you're my colleague, <Player>! A diplomat! Ok, I'll stop chasing him. Let him fly where he wants.
LinerNo=His actions irritated me so much that I can't but agree to this demand. Inspite of all your efforts, <Target> will die very soon.
LinerNo1=You'd better be careful not to become next. My liner is equiped so that it can destroy a hundred of such bastards and then easily escape!
LinerOk=He did start it! But if you, <Player>, insist, I don't mind.
PirateNo=You, <Player>, are a good guy, and I could agree with you. But robbery is my business! No way, in spite of all your efforts, <Target> will die very soon.
PirateOk=Are you mad, <Player>? This is my business! What else can I do to earn a living?
PirateOk=Just don't think that I quit. Such a strong guy is not one to be trifled with. I'll find another victim.
PlayerSend=Stop attack now! <Target> is under my protection!
RangerNo=I understand that you and <Target> may be friends, but it's a point of honor for me! I won't stop attack!
RangerNo1=Who the hell are you to tell me what to do, <Player>? I won't stop attack, and I don't care about your opinion!
RangerOk=Of course, I'll leave him alone, because I'm not gonna quarrel with you, <Player>. But I should say, it's not your business, actually!
TargetGiveGoods=I'll throwpart of my cargo overboard. Take it, <Player>, don't be shy! I owe you an immeasurable debt.
TargetGiveMoney=Thank you, <Player>, for your help. I transfer <Money> cr to your account as a token of friendship and respect.
TargetMayRunAway=I wasn't afraid of him at all, he would have never caught me. I'm flying very fast. But still, thank you, <Player>.
TargetNotFearShip=Thank you, <Player>, but I could have made it alone.
TargetThanks=Thank you, <Player>, so much! Unfortunately, there's no way I can thank you for this.
TransportNo=His actions irritated me so much that I can't but agree to this demand. Inspite of all your efforts, <Target> will die very soon.
TransportNo1=Get lost, <Player>, or your turn will come right now. Death awaits for everyone who will stand in the way of a transport ship!
TransportOk=He started this! But if you, <Player>, insist, I don't mind.
WarriorNo=Are you mad, <Player>! I'm on duty. Order is order. You're not my commander.
WarriorOk=Ok, <Player>, if you want, I'll do it. I do respect you.
WarriorOk=And let <Target> get out of here as fast as possible until I change my mind!
