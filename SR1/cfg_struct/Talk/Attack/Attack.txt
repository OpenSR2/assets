ComputerInFear=At the moment I'm going to solve my problems. Let's talk later, in more peaceful situation.
ComputerReadyAttack=I'm fighting <Target>, can you help me?
DiplomatFear=I believe you are mistaken. This is a peaceful diplomatic ship, it is not designed for combat. Sorry, but I can't help you.
DiplomatFear1=As a peaceful diplomat, I'm not going to endanger my life. Look for another accomplice.
DiplomatHaveBusiness=I've got lots to do now, I'm in a hurry. Sorry, but I have to reject your offer.
DiplomatHaveBusiness1=I'm afraid I'm in a hurry for a very important meeting.
DiplomatOk=I agree to abandon my mission for a while and join you.
DiplomatOk1=This ship is disloyal towards my government and I will be delighted if it's eliminated. To arms!

DiplomatSend1=I need help. Villain <Target> wants to encroach upon the relics of my people!
DiplomatSuspect=I do not have enough reasons to trust you.

DiplomatSuspect1=No! I don't trust you and I won't take part in this enterprise!
DiplomatWeFriends=This attack can entail undesirable diplomatic consequences. I reject your offer.
DiplomatWeFriends1=This ship is friendly towards my government. Do you just realise what you are offering me?
LinerFear=The passengers are afraid of the combat. As a captain, I reject your offer.
LinerFear1=I'm responsible for lives of my passengers, and I can't guarantee they will live through this bloody fight.
LinerFear2=Our heart is with you and we would have gone to fight... If not for the little kids onboard, we cannot risk their lives.
LinerHaveBusiness=My route is rigidly defined, I cannot deviate from it, not for a single minute.
LinerHaveBusiness1=I'm a captain of a scheduled flight, I've got a timetable. I'm afraid it's impossible.

LinerOk1=Now this is right! I'm joining you.
LinerOk2=Cool. Just let me recharge the batteries before combat. Start it.
LinerSend=I suggest joint attack of <Target>. The spoils is all yours. My interest is entirely personal.

LinerSuspect=I don't trust you, and I won't attack anyone.
LinerSuspect1=I'm a respectable liner and you are a sleazy character. I don't trust you.
LinerWeFriends=I'm on a scheduled flight, firstly. Secondly, I have nothing against this vessel.
LinerWeFriends1=This ship is my ally, and attacking allies could get a civil pilot to capital punishment, you know.
PirateFear=I believe I won't get anything from this business except a broken ship. The enemy's too cool for us.
PirateFear1=Nah, it's a cool guy over there, no chance!
PirateHaveBusiness=A most promising suggestion, but I'm too busy now. Maybe later.
PirateHaveBusiness1=I would have given you a hand, it seems worth it, but I now have other plans.
PirateOk=I'm in need of dough and I can smell profit. Immediate attack.
PirateOk1=Agreed. Spoils fifty-fifty!
PirateOk2=That's great! My hands've been itching for a while, but I was afraid to do it alone.
PirateOk3=Excellent, I'm joining in the attack. Rob and kill in a good company - what can be better?
PirateOk4=I love murder and robbery. I'm with you!
PirateSend=Let's join and butcher <Target>. Spoils will be divided fifty-fifty. Agreed?
PirateSend1=Hey, brother, can you see <Target>? Let's dispatch it, like good pirates.?????, ??????, ?????? <Target>?
PirateSuspect=I won't consider your offer. I don't like your snout.
PirateSuspect1=I only go to battle with my pals whom I trust. And I don't know you.
PirateWeFriends=This ship is friendly towards my government. Do you just realise what you are offering me?
PirateWeFriends1=It's my old pal over there, I don't want to shoot at him.
PlayerSend=I suggest joint attack.
RangerFear=I don't want to take part in this action, for it is doomed to failure.
RangerFear1=Can't you see it's cooler that both of us? Thanks, but no thanks.
RangerHaveBusiness=I cannot consider your offer. I have other things to do now.
RangerHaveBusiness1=I'm extremely busy, sorry.
RangerOk=Accept. Let's surround it and attack.
RangerOk1=Good, let's do it! I'll attack from behind, and you take the front. I can't take the front, afraid for my cargo.
RangerSend=I suggest to attack <Target>
RangerSuspect=I do not trust you as an ally so I won't support you.
RangerSuspect1=But can I trust you? No, don't count on me here.
RangerSuspect2=The idea is not bad, but I don't trust you.
RangerWeFriends=I don't want to attack a friendly ship.
RangerWeFriends1=I won't fire at friends.
TransportFear=I can't do it. My ship is falling to pieces, it's all worn out. Battles are the last thing on my mind.
TransportFear1=I've got valuable cargo on board and weak weapons. You attack it if you wish so.
TransportHaveBusiness=I've got lots to do, perishable goods onboard, I just ahve no time.
TransportHaveBusiness1=Maybe, next time when I have more free time.
TransportOk=Agreed. I'll attack from behind, and you take the front. I can't take the front, afraid for my cargo.
TransportOk1=Sure, sure! The two of us will deal with it in no time.
TransportOk2=All right, my business will only be better off if we kill it.
TransportSend=I suggest supporting me in combat against <Target>. With the two of us, we'll certainly overpower it.
TransportSend1=I need a support of fire! I'm afraid I won't be able to combat <Target> alone!
TransportSuspect=I don't think you are a reliable partner in such risky enterprise.
TransportWeFriends=I'm not going to attack a friend and endanger my cargo.
TransportWeFriends1=This is unheard of, to attack friends. You must be a shameless immoral character if you suggest me such a thing.
WarriorFear=Attacking this ship is madness. I'm telling you this, I'm a pro in these things.
WarriorHaveBusiness=Our government has given us another mission and we cannot abandon it now.
WarriorHaveBusiness1=At the moment I'm taking part in another operation so I can't join you.
WarriorOk=Headquaters agree to this attack. Load guns, head for the target!
WarriorOk1=This joint operation is acceptable. Attack it from two flanks!
WarriorSend=My government has ordered me to attack <Target>. Join me if you are ready to support me. I can't make it myself.
WarriorSend1=Military action is on. Target: <Target>. Will you join me?
WarriorSuspect=My government forbids me to enter military agreements with suspicious people.
WarriorWeFriends=I can't see any reason for attack.
WarriorWeFriends1=You've turned to a wrong person. Military fleet serves the law which does not encourage attacking friendly commonwealth ships.
WeAlreadyHavePact=I cannot take this offer because I have peace agreement with <Target>.
WeAlreadyHavePact1=I promised to guard <Target> and cannot accept your offer.
