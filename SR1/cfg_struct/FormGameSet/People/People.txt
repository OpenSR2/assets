Pirate=I'm a well known pirate <Name>. I was born on planet Earth in 2978. I want to become a ranger to get a licence for killing and robbery.
Trader=I'm a humble realtor, my name is <Name>. I cannot sleep well while I know that Klissans are conquering our Galaxy. I want to help our army.
Warrior=I'm <Name>. I'm an old soldier and I left the army long ago. I've got nothing to lose, so I want to become a ranger and drive Klissans out of our Galaxy.
