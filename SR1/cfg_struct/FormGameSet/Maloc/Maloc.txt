Pirate=My name is <Name>. I rip through time and space. I'm ready to become a ranger, for glory and profit.
Trader=I, <Name>, have long been engaged in trading, real shame for a Maloq. But now I want to rehabilitate myself by becoming a ranger and proving that I am still worth something.
Warrior=I'm called <Name> and I've been thrown out of regular army, for constant drinking and fights. I want to take part in the military action, if only as a ranger.
