End=Here is your <Money> cr, <Ranger>. Maloqs are grateful to you. Even though you are just a trader, you've earned our respect. We wish you every possible success in future military undertakings.
PlanetRace=Maloc
Start=Most of our best military pilots are at Universal Maloqi Police Games. Only green rookies are now patrolling our system and you can't trust them even with defending a freighter. <Ranger>, we therefore demand that you help them with their duties. Take off at once and start patrolling our space. If none of the peaceful ships is destroyed before <Date>, your mission will be complete and we will pay you <Money> cr. Believe us, this is much more than the salary of our regular guards. But if you are successful, we are ready to give it even to such petty trader as you.
Status=Trader
