End=<Ranger>, it is a miracle, indeed no civil ship has suffered in the system! Sultan Nekshisk is now feeling much better. At least, half an hour ago, when he heard that a Maloqi transport was destroyed in the vicinity, he did not jump from the balcony shouting "Klissans!". He has really made excellent progress. Please take your <Money> cr, you've deserved it.

Start=The ruler of our planet, Sultan Nekshisk is now in great trouble. He suffers from paranoid fever. He constantly has hallucinations of Klissans. No sooner one of our own lyakushas' attacks a passing by ship, Nekshisk claims that is was a Klissan attack who have invaded the system under the mask of the good Pelengs. He is getting worse with every day but, to make matters worse, we have no right to prevent him from getting the full information on what is going on in the system. Doctors say, curing him is possible, but only under the condition if there is no further disturbance. We need to remove the cause of his fits, that is, to temporarily stop lyakushas' operating in our system. This is indeed awful! All lyakushas are going to laugh at us! But, on the other hand, you are yourself a well-known lyakusha so if you make a deal with them, we won't seem such perverts.
Start=We are paying you <Money> cr if our system is quiet and secure for all civil ships, even alien, until <Date>. It is the only way to guard our Sultan against these uncontrollable fears and we hope this will give him enough time to get on his way to recovery.
