End=Yeah, I see, here's the package with the goods... Hmmm, three bugs are missing... You say, crawled away? Well, it happens sometimes, not to worry. These ultra-modern Human models can run and hide to prevent themselves from being spotted. I'm sure those three are now somewhere in your ship, already switched to surveillance mode. Well, this might prove to be very useful to us, either.
End=Upon subtracting the cost of the missing three bugs, we transfer <Money> cr to your account.

Start=<Ranger>, you can be of service to our intelligence. Our friends Gaalians are our allies. Everybody knows that. But unfortunately we cannot trust anyone and so we regretfully have to literally stuff their government buildings with our bugs. Gaalians are tough guys and constantly scan their premises and remove our detectors. To make a long story short: on <ToPlanet> in the system of <ToStar> their counterintelligence has managed to uncover and arrest our Gaalian resident who, pressed by their interrogators told them the location of the bug store.
Start=We need to deliver a package with new bugs to our reserve agent so that his activity can go on as usual. Our agent will wait for you in government building for <Day> days, but will need to go to his hiding place afterwards. If you are late, the contract is void.
