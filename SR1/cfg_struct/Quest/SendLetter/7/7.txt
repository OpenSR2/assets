Start=Two days ago a most regretful thing happened on our planet, which shocked us all: Human ambassador Assirius Daedalus, who represented humanitarian mission from <ToPlanet>, died in an accident. According to his will, we cremated his body and now we need to send the ashes to his home planet, in the system of <ToStar>. <Ranger>, this small urn will not take much space on your ship. We have already sent a message to his relatives and they will conduct all the necessary ceremonies as soon as they get the remains.
