End=<Ranger>, you are really a qualified fighter. <Ship> was well guarded while the contract was in force. We feel we've found good use for <Money> cr that you now get.

Start=Our Dalani Ulgenar Voyi, very much respected by our people, has suddenly departed to unknown destination on his posh ship <Ship>. We suspect that he is being blackmailed, and this is confirmed by the fact that he did not say anything about the goal of his trip, which is usual practice in all Fayean consulates. That is why our wise leaders have taken a prudent decision, to hire a bodyguard who could escort Dalani discreetly. We know that you have plenty of fighting experience and we offer you <Money> cr if ship <Ship> is intact until <Date>. If you think this is not enough, we could increase the amount. At the moment Dalani is in the system of <InStar> but we do not know anything about his further plans. Our planet's people would be extremely grateful to you if Ulgenar Voyi returns to us in physiologically sound state.
Status=Warrior
