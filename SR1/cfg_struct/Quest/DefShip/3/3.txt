Start=In the system of <InStar> there is a very much respected pilot <FShip>, by the way, he is a pirate like you. He honourable robs Human freighters and destroys Fayean passenger ships. But recently we got a SOS signal from him. Some scoundrels, probably from local anti-terrorist forces have got on his tail. And he is a respectable citizen and hero on <FromPlanet>.
Start=We've heard that all pirates are brothers and are always ready to help each other out. Is this true? If <Ship> is still alive at least until <Date>, all of our community is going to be grateful. Well, possibly we will think of something else to reward you.
Status=Pirate
