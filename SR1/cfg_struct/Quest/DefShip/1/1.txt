End=Your contract is complete, <Ranger>. We've just received money transfer and we are paying you 30 per cent, <Money> cr.
InThisSystem=Yes
PlanetRace=Maloc
ShipType=Transport
Start=We represent security agency "Cruel Axe". The captain of a freighter <Ship> loaded with some junk has paid us to guard him on his route. Too bad our agents and draqars are all now engaged in other operations. Well, and to tell you the truth, we have no wish to get shame on our heads and guard some filthy merchant. That's why we are using private pilots. Maybe you, as a trader feel professional solidarity and want to help your colleague? This would be most honourable. In this case, if you take the mission and complete it successfully, so that <FShip> stays alive for <Day> days, we will share the sum we'll get from the captain. The ship is not far away, in this system.
Status=Trader
